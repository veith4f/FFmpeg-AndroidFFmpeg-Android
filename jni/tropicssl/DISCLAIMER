No version of TropicSSL has been certified under FIPS 140. This is unlikely to
happen unless/until an organization is willing to fund and shepherd the
validation process, which typically requires several months and many thousands
of dollars.

TropicSSL has not undergone external auditing for security vulnerbilities or
other related issues. While best industry accepted security practices have been
folloed by the authors in regards to securing the code against security
vulnerbilities, up to and including timing and other side-channel attacks, there
are no guarantees that any such issues do not exist. These issues can be serious
and may fully compromise your application or installation.

Security vulnerbilities and discussions will be posted on the TropicSSL mailing
list, which can be found at:
